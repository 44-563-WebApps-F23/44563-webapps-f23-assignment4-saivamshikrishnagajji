        <p>
            Dr. Stockmann. Not at all; come in.
            <br>
            Morten Kiil (with another chuckle). Oho!—is he in this too?
            <br>
            Hovstad. What do you mean?
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann. Certainly he is.
            <br>
            Morten Kiil. I might have known it! It must get into the papers. You
            know how to do it, Thomas! Set your wits to work. Now I must go.
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann. Won't you stay a little while?
            <br>
            Morten Kiil. No, I must be off now. You keep up this game for all it is
            worth; you won't repent it, I'm damned if you will!
            <br>
            (He goes out; MRS. STOCKMANN follows him into the hall.)
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann (laughing). Just imagine—the old chap doesn't believe a
            word of all this about the water supply.
            <br>
            Hovstad. Oh that was it, then?
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, that was what we were talking about. Perhaps it is
            the same thing that brings you here?
            <br>
            Hovstad. Yes, it is, Can you spare me a few minutes, Doctor?
            <br>
            
            Dr. Stockmann. As long as you like, my dear fellow.
            <br>
            Hovstad. Have you heard from the Mayor yet?
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann. Not yet. He is coming here later.
            <br>
            Hovstad. I have given the matter a great deal of thought since last
            night.
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann. Well?
            <br>
            Hovstad. From your point of view, as a doctor and a man of science,
            this affair of the water supply is an isolated matter. I mean, you do
            not realise that it involves a great many other things.
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann. How do you mean?—Let us sit down, my dear fellow. No,
            sit here on the couch. (HOVSTAD Sits down on the couch, DR. STOCKMANN
            On a chair on the other side of the table.) Now then. You mean that—?
            <br>
            Hovstad. You said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to
            impurities in the soil.
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann. Yes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass
            up at Molledal.
            <br>
            Hovstad. Begging your pardon, Doctor, I fancy it is due to quite
            another morass altogether.
            <br>
            Dr. Stockmann. What morass?
