<h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4> 
<p>Are you in, Thomas?</p>

<h4>Dr. Stockmann</h4> 
<p>(from within his room).</p>
<p>Yes, I have just come in.</p>
<p>(Comes into the room.)</p>

<h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4> 
<p>A letter from your brother.</p>

<h4>Dr. Stockmann.</h4>

<h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4> 
<p>I will tell you what, Thomas—you should be good natured, and share the credit of this with him. Couldn't you make out that it was he who set you on the scent of this discovery?</p>  

<h4>Dr. Stockmann</h4> 
<p>I am quite willing. If only I can get the thing set right. I—</p>

<h4>Morten Kiil</h4> 
<p>(slyly).</p>
 <p>Is it—is it true?</p>

 <h4>Mrs. Stockmann.</h4> 
 <p>(going to the door).</p>
 <p> Father!—is it you?</p>
